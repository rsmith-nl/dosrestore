INTRODUCTION
------------
This is the readme file for version 1.1 of the 'dosrestore' program,
released on 2017-12-28.

This program extracts the contents of backups made with the old DOS backup
program.

I wrote it to save some files from a cuple of old backups I had laying
around. It has been tested to work correctly on those backups, which have
been made with DOS 5 or thereabouts.

It parses only the information which it needs from the backup files,
i.e. file names and sizes. The backup control file contains extra info,
probably file dates and times, but those are not parsed in this version.

patch.
