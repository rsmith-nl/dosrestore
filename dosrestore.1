.SH NAME
dosrestore \- a program to restore old DOS backups.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dosrestore
/path/to/backup 

.SH DESCRIPTION 
This manual page documents version 1.0.0 of the dosrestore program. This
program extracts the contents from backups made by the old DOS "backup"
program. It writes the restored files and directories to the current
working directory.

It starts looking for backups, in the form of a couple of files named
"backup.001" and "restore.001" in the directory given on the command
line. Those names can be upper or lower case. If these files have been
processed, and the contents of the control file indicate there are more
files, the program asks for the next files.

.SH OPTIONS
This programs has no options.

.SH BUGS
This program has only been tested on a couple of backups, made with DOS 5
or thereabouts.

It parses only the information which it needs from the backup files,
i.e. file names and sizes. The backup control file contains extra info,
probably file dates and times, but those are not parsed in this version.
